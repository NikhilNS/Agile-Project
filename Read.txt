We have created web based application for the project and output is generated in ged file using database. First open index.jsp which has form in it. Fill the data and press submit. If the data already exists in the file then it will be redirected to existing.jsp. If not,then DetailsSubmit1.jsp will be executed. There are two other buttons which represent the data in order by ID and Famlily name consequently and evem generates output file in D:\ drive. Path can be changed if D:\ is not available. We have used sql database to store the data and manipulate it.
